English Vocabulary Learning base on Dynameic Assessment
===
- An instruction platform.

This project is completed during the internship.The original idea is work with a companion robot(hardware:Respeaker Core).
Teacher could create course and put the teaching material on it.All the vocabularies teacher add would be stored in database and the companion robot could get all the content and use Dynamic Assessment for Vocabulary Testing.The system and the student score record could be accessed all the time by user. 
實習時做的學習網,讓老師在上面創建課程新增單字以隨機出題的方式做測驗及成績紀錄.
